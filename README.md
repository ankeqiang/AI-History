This repository presents a preliminary exploration of how artificial intelligence (AI) can support and transform historical research practices. Based on reflections following the AI in Science â€“ Online Workshop organized by the European Commission (May 15, 2025), the project critiques existing models of the "scientific process" as overly centered on the natural sciences. It proposes an alternative, iterative workflow tailored to the humanities, particularly history. The project is structured in two parts: (1) a conceptual framework for an AI-augmented historical research workflow, and (2) a detailed case study illustrating interactions between human cognition, computational methods, and large language models (LLMs).
